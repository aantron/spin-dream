## Requirements

- The optional TailwindCSS setup requires NodeJS 12.13 or higher. If your system uses a previous version of NodeJS, we recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install a newer version.
  ```bash
  # Install NVM
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
  # Reload bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  # Install an NPM version, 14 is the latest LTS
  nvm install 14
  # Use the version in your current prompt
  nvm use 14
  ```


## To Do

- [ ] Add Caqti examples
- [ ] Skip crunch in development

## Acknowledgments

- Welcome page design borrowed from TailwindCSS playground
- Turbolink setup borrowed from Haskell's IHP
- Directory structure heavily inspired by Elixir's Phoenix
